For this exercise, the goal is to complete the pizza class by adding some modifications

Pizza Class:

1. Refactor the initialize method to use keyword arguments.
2. Create a class variable, @@all. We will use this variable to keep track of the number of new pizzas that are created from the Pizza class.
3. Define a class method .all that is responsible for reading the class variable @@all.
4. Define a #save method that will save each new instance to the class array and return the instance.
5. Define a method .find_by_name that will accept name as an argument and return a matching pizza instance.

CLI:
Add a menu option for a user to search a pizza with a given name
Refactor all code in CLI relying on PIZZAS to using the Pizza.all method
